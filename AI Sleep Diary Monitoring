# AI Sleep Diary Monitoring
In this project, I will be using a Sleep Diary to track the amount of sleep I get each night for about 3 weeks. I want to use this diary to increase the amount of sleep I get each night. I will record this on a Microsoft Excel Sheet using a sleep diary template from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. I will provide ChatGPT with a qualitative summary of my week such my mood throughout the mood, to get tips for improvement. 

Project Notes:

- Please remember to keep your repo private when you create it from this template.
- Be sure to create your report in the **intro-gen-ai** organization. 
- The name of the repo should be the name of the project, or a shortened version of the name.
- Each section should be completed by the deadline indicated. You submit by making a commit of this README.md file. Except for minor edits, please do no change the Proposal, Goals, or Metrics sections after the submission deadline.
- General guidance on formatting writing in markdown files (like this README.md file) is at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax.

## Project Proposal 
**Due October 26, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words total across all of the sections below

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
It is well known that most people should be getting at least eight hours of sleep a night, however, I regularly do not get this much sleep on weekdays. One weekend, I usually crash and sleep upwards of 11 hours due to the sleep debt I have accumulated throughout the week and this cycle repeats itself for weeks. It leaves me exhausted on some days and I am occasionally tired by evening on many days. It can also have a negative impact on my academic experience. Not getting enough sleep is associated with recalling less memory which extends the amount of time I spend studying weekly
